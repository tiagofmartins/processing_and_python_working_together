# Processing ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ Python

This code demonstrates a simple method to _transfer_ images from Processing (the generator) to Python (the evaluator) and get in return fitness or evaluation scores.

This can be useful for instante to implement an evolutionary system to evolve images or any other kind of solutions in the visual domain.

How to test this code?
1. Download this repository
2. Run the generator by opening the Processing sketch located at `/generator`
3. You will see a window with images and the message "Waiting fitness"
4. Run the evaluator by executing the Python script `evaluator.py`
5. You will see fitness values displayed below the images

Now that you tested this code, go ahead the change the generator and evaluator code!
